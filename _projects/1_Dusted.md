excerpt: "A future ready rebuild for an award winning design agency."
content: "Whilst working as a frontend developer at Dusted, an award-winning design and branding studio, I had the privilege of building their new website as part of their exciting rebrand. The previous website suffered from major content stagnation, and the future build needed increased scalability. I built the new site using a modern headless architecture including Next.js, TypeScript, React and Sanity CMS. I developed over 25 customizable modules, including 5 interactive, bespoke animations (coded and not exported from After Effects). I integrated the forms with HubSpot's API for unified marketing. As a result, one of the sector pages contributed to an enterprise-level client conversion within a couple of weeks of launch. The website was also featured in an article for [Design Week](https://www.designweek.co.uk/why-are-so-many-design-agencies-rebranding-right-now/) and contributed to the agency's first-ever Honourable Mention in [Awwwards.com](https://www.awwwards.com/sites/dusted)."
