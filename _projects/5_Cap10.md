excerpt: "Adaptable launch for investment group startup."
content: "I developed a 10-page client website for this investment startup agency, specializing in mission-critical business services. The project involved a staggered launch and Tailwind CSS for the first time. The client appreciated the flexible approach to launch, and the site achieved scores of over 90% as measured by Core Web Vitals."
