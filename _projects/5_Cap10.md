excerpt: "Adaptable launch for investment group startup."
content: "An investment agency specializing in mission-critical business services. As the company was founded in 2021, it had no existing web presence. We took an incremental approach to launch, pushing the new work live after each sprint. The client was complimentary regarding our flexible approach, and the site achieved strong, 90 percent-plus performance scores in Google Lighthouse. The choice of Tailwind CSS was successful for this small website with minimal design. (Website no longer live). "
