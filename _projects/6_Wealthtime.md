excerpt: "A multisite for a leading FinTech platform."
content: "A WordPress multisite for a financial technology platform. The client wanted a multisite architecture for its different audiences (advisors, investors, and employees). Additionally, the development phase occurred during a merger with another company, Novia Financial. We responded to these challenges by building a WordPress multisite, complete with a reusable, flexible page layout. The website achieves high performance scores in Lighthouse, and the client recognized our long-term efforts. One of the key learning points from this project is that the basics should always take priority over complex features."
