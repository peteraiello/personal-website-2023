excerpt: "A multisite for a leading FinTech platform."
content: "The challenge of this project included developing a multisite for its different audiences, including Advisors, Investors and Employees, and the timeline overlapped with a company merger. I built the Website as a WordPress multisite and developed 30+ modules of varying complexity, including a filterable media section. The website achieved high performance scores as measured using Core Web Vitals, and the client recognized our long-term efforts. One of the key learning outcomes from this project is that I should always tackle the basics first."
