excerpt: "Headless architecture for a leading investment group."
content: "I built the headless frontend for PIDG, an investment group delivering financial aid to developing countries. I collaborated with UX researchers and designers to translate elegant design systems from Figma into 30+ reusable modules using Storybook, React, TypeScript, and Next.js. I developed flexible layout patterns pulling data from WordPress via GraphQL queries, creating filterable case study pages, careers sections, and team directories. I optimized site performance to achieve scores of over 90% in Core Web Vitals, whilst making content editing easy for the marketing team."
