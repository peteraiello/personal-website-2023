excerpt: "Headless architecture for a leading investment group."
content: "PIDG (The Private Infrastructure Development Group) is a leading investment group that helps generate investment across developing countries. The brief was to deliver a website that would leverage the advantages of headless architecture (performance and security) whilst still being easily editable using a familiar CMS (WordPress). A research phase included the design of wireframes, followed by the creation of an in-depth design system using Figma, which featured 30+ modules. The development phase consisted of interpreting the design system as fully customizable modules. Key pages included filterable news and case studies sections, team pages, and career listings. The project features a flexible page layout, with all of the queries crafted using GraphQL. The website achieves high scores (over 90%) in the different categories of Core Vitals, including Performance, Accessibility, and Best Practice. "
