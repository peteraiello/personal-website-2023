excerpt: "High-performance website for a specialist bank."
content: "I maintained the headless frontend for HTB, a UK specialist bank built using Gatsby, React and GraphQL. I used t-shirt sizing to accurately scope new features, including landing pages and UI enhancements. I developed new landing pages, including the Go For More pages, and promoted them to 19,000+ LinkedIn followers. My work supported long-term client retention and brand consistency across their digital presence."
