excerpt: "High performance website for a specialist bank."
content: "HTB (Hampshire Trust Bank) is a specialist bank offering a range of financial services, including savings accounts through to mortgages. As one of the earlier instances of headless development, we maintained both a WordPress site to see the changes and a headless frontend built using Gatsby. I was responsible for everything from general snagging to in-depth UI updates, including landing pages and navigation overhauls. The work contributed to long-term client retention. The “Go For More” landing page is a good example of work completed for this client, with the web page being promoted to their 19,000+ followers on LinkedIn."
