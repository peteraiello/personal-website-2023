excerpt: "A cost saving calculator for a FinTech giant."
content: "I built an interactive cost-savings calculator for SS&C Intralinks, a global FinTech company specializing in document redaction and translation services. I translated Figma designs into a fully responsive Single Page Application using Gatsby and React, then integrated it into the client's Drupal website. The calculator became a key lead generation tool, promoted to their 100,000+ social media followers and helped quantify ROI for potential clients submitting enquiries.
