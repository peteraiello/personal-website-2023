My current position is working as a Front-end developer at Dusted. Thanks to the company's 
success in the world of branding, I have had the privilege of working with prestigious 
clients from a diverse range of sectors, including a multinational car manufacturer (Mahindra)
and an essential government accreditor (UKAS). I see my role as looking for opportunities 
to realise the designs in a way that puts the user first (performant, accessible). More 
recently, I have been progressing my skills, from WordPress to working with Headless environments.
